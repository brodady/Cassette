# Cassette

A lightweight, self-contained GML script for creating smooth animations. Cassette provides a rich collection of standard easing functions and a simple system for building complex, chainable transitions. 

Animate anything from UI elements to character movements with just a few lines of code.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart Guide

### 1\. Installation

Simply add the `Cassette` script to your GameMaker project.

### 2\. Usage 

In a persistent controller object, define a Cassette manager. The manager is a singleton for all animations, so you need only define it once.

I recomnmend using 'ease' for semantic clarity i.e. ease.InOutElastic(t)

```gml
// Create Event
ease = new Cassette();
```

*Note: You can toggle between frame-based and time-based animations by setting the `CASSETTE_USE_DELTA_TIME` macro at the top of the script.*

### 3\. Animate\!

You can now start, stop, and get values from the static `ease` manager anywhere in your code.

To start a new animation, use `.transition()`. You can chain multiple tweens together using `.add()`.

```gml
// oPlayer :: Create Event

// Animate from current x to x+200, then hold position for 30 frames
ease.transition("player_x", x, x + 200, 60, ease.OutExpo)
    .add(x + 200, x + 200, 30, ease.InOutSine);

// Animate y position with a PingPong effect that repeats 3 times
ease.transition("player_y", y, y + 100, 90, ease.OutBounce, CASSETTE_ANIM.PingPong, 3);
```

To get the current value of an animation, use `ease.get_value()`. Apply this value in a Step or Draw event.

```gml
// oPlayer :: Step Event

// The second argument is a default value if the animation isn't active
x = ease.get_value("player_x", x);
y = ease.get_value("player_y", y);
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Using Custom Curves

Ease seamlessly integrates with GameMaker's built-in Animation Curves.

1.  Create an Animation Curve asset in your project (e.g., `ac_MyCurve`).
2.  Pass it to the `ease.custom()` method to prepare it for use.
3.  Use the result as the easing function in your transition.

<!-- end list -->

```gml
// Prepare your custom curve
var my_custom_ease = ease.custom(ac_MyCurve);

// Use it in a transition!
ease.transition("my_value", 0, 100, 120, my_custom_ease);

// Apply the value
my_variable = ease.get_value("my_value", my_variable);
```
